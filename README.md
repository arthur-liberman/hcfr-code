# HCFR

## Welcome to the HCFR project

This repository is a continuation of the mostly abandoned repository which can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/hcfr/code/), based on the latest zoyd branch.

## Windows Users

To compile the source, open the solution file ColorHCFR2019.sln in Visual Studio 2019 or greater (for newer VS versions, allow any project conversions to happen).
The solution uses the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects that needs to be installed on Visual Studio as a prerequisite.

Select ColorHCFR as main project and build (Make sure that you build in Release configuration).

In order to run you may need to copy the dlls from the devlib directory into your Release directories.
